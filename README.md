# 👋 Hey there, I'm Nicole!

I'm a student developer building ✨cozy, creative, human-centered✨ web apps — with a focus on clean code, accessible design, and vibes. 

I write code under the **Softstack Studios** umbrella, with my main portfolio series called **CodeLatte** — because nothing pairs better with logic than lattes.

## ☕ CodeLatte Series
Projects with heart, built with intention:
- `bean-counter` – a warm little database manager
- `grade-au-lait` – a smooth midterm grade calculator
- `compound-cup` – brews up your compound interest
- `drip-filter` – filters data like a slow pour

> *(New repos coming soon — stay tuned!)*

## ♿ Accessibility Philosophy

I believe in building code that includes everyone — disabled users, screen reader users, neurodivergent thinkers, and those who are often left out of design decisions. If it’s not usable by all, it’s not finished.

*Softstack Studios builds soft things, for every kind of mind.*🫶

Caffeine-coded, community-grounded. Made with care — accessible, rooted, and resilient.
